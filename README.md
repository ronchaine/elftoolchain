Elftoolchain
============

Go to [project website](elftoolchain.sourceforge.net) for details.

This repository is mostly here because I wanted clang-buildable
version somewhere where it's easy to reach.

The changes from project's sourceforge SVN repo are available in
`.patch` files

Feel free to use them as you will, the only reason they are hanging
there is that I was too lazy to make myself a sourceforge account
to submit a ticket.
